* 0.1.2 - <2014-07-25 Fri>

** Feature: set unification support

It is now possible to place logic variables within sets, adderall
learned how to traverse them. This means one can now do:

(run* [q]
  (memberáµ’ 3 (set [1 2 q q])))
;=> [3]

** Feature: Support lazy results

One can now pass :lazy as the first argument to the run and run*
macros, and they will return a generator, and not force them into a
list.

** Miscellaneous: Drop the toolz dependency

The library only used the interval function from toolz, which was an
overkill. It now ships with an internal implementation of the
function, and drops the toolz dependency.
